# Introduction to HED

**HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors)** is a framework for annotating events in time-series data using a structured vocabulary. If you're working with EEG, fMRI, or other neuroimaging  or behavioral data, HED helps you describe *what happened* during your experiment in a way that computers can understand and process.

## Why use HED?

````{admonition} **Traditional event annotation problems**
:class: attention

- Event codes like "1", "2", "stimulus_onset" tell you little about what actually happened
- Different studies use different terminology for the same events
- Impossible to search across datasets or compare experiments automatically
- Manual interpretation required for every analysis
````

````{admonition} **HED solutions**
:class: tip

- **Standardized vocabulary**: Everyone uses the same terms for the same concepts
- **Machine-actionable**: Computers can automatically find and analyze events
- **Hierarchical structure**: Supports both simple and detailed annotations
- **Cross-study analysis**: Compare and combine data from different experiments
- **BIDS integration**: Works seamlessly with Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)
- **NWB integration**: Works seamlessly with Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)
````

## What does HED annotation look like?

Instead of cryptic event codes, HED lets you describe events in plain, structured language:

````{admonition} **Example: Simple HED annotation**

**Traditional event marker:** `stimulus_type: 3`

**HED annotation:** `Sensory-event, Experimental-stimulus, Visual-presentation, (Image, Face)`

This tells us: A sensory event occurred involving visual presentation of a face image as part of the experimental protocol.
````

**HED transforms meaningless event codes into rich, searchable descriptions that unlock powerful cross-study analysis.**

### What HED gives you:
- **Before HED**: "Event code 3 occurred" ‚Üí Meaningless without documentation  
- **After HED**: "Visual presentation of a face image as experimental stimulus" ‚Üí Self-explanatory and searchable

## Quick start

For role-specific guidance and detailed workflows, see [**How can you use HED?**](HowCanYouUseHed.md) to find 
information tailored to your needs (experimenters, annotators, analysts, developers, or schema builders).

For quick hands-on learning, start with the tutorials:
- **New to HED?** Try the [HED annotation quickstart](HedAnnotationQuickstart.md)
- **Have BIDS data?** Follow the [BIDS annotation quickstart](BidsAnnotationQuickstart.md)  
- **Want to analyze?** Read the [HED search guide](HedSearchGuide.md)

## Key concepts to understand

Before diving into HED annotation, familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts:

````{dropdown} **HED Schema - The Vocabulary**
:color: primary

The HED schema is a structured vocabulary organized as a hierarchy. Think of it like a taxonomy:
- **Event** ‚Üí **Sensory-event** ‚Üí **Visual-presentation**
- **Item** ‚Üí **Object** ‚Üí **Man-made-object** ‚Üí **Tool**
- **Property** ‚Üí *Sensory-pproperty** ‚Üí **Visual-presentation**

You generally tag using short form (`Face`), but tools can automatically expand to long form (`Item/Biological-item/Anatomical-item/Body-part/Head/Face`) for tasks such as searching for all body parts.
````

````{dropdown} **Tags and Grouping**  
:color: info

- **Tags**: Individual terms from the HED schema (`Sensory-event`, `Red`, `Onset`)
- **Groups**: Related tags in parentheses `(Visual-presentation, (Face, Image))`
- **Comma separation**: Different aspects of the same event

Example: `Sensory-event, Experimental-stimulus, (Visual-presentation, (Face, Image))`
````

````{dropdown} **Annotation Levels**
:color: success

- **Basic**: Describe what happened (`Visual-presentation, Face`)
- **Detailed**: Include experimental context (`Experimental-stimulus, Condition-variable/Famous-face`)  
- **Advanced**: Use definitions and temporal scope for complex experiments
````

````{dropdown} **Validation and Tools**
:color: warning

HED provides tools to check your annotations:
- **Online validator**: Check syntax and schema compliance
- **Python/MATLAB libraries**: Integrate validation and analysis into your workflows
- **BIDS validator**: Automatically checks HED in BIDS datasets
